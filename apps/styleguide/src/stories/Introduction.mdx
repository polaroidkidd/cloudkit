<h1>Welcome to the cloudkit.dle.dev Styleguide!</h1>
<p>
	This is a styleguide for the cloudkit.dle.dev project. It is a collection of components and
	patterns that can be used to build the cloudkit.dle.dev website. It is built using Svelte and
	Storybook.
</p>

<p>
	This is currently a work in progress. The components and patterns are being developed and will be
	added to the styleguide as they are completed. Some functions (such as the Theme documentation)
	are not yet implemented. They will follow at a later date.
</p>
